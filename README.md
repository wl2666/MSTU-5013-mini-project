# MSTU-5013-mini-project

## Strategy
This color game is created to practice our understanding and knowledge about Riot. Especially, we are interested in practicing the events and control flow of Riot, how different tags interact with each other, etc.

## Scope
### Functional Specifications
visual&interactive: The color blocks will change according to the users' choices. If the user chooses the correct color block, the RGB background will change accordingly; if the user chooses the wrong color block, the chosen color block will be hidden and the user needs to choose again until he hits the correct block.

feedback: If the user chooses the wrong color block, a feedback will show up as a hint. The user can toggle with the slider as he drags the slider.

###Content Requirement
The content of RGB color block will change according to the game difficulty level. In the easy mode, the only difference between different color blocks is one dimension of R,G,B. In the intermediate mode, two dimensions of R,G,B are different among different color blocks. In the hard mode, all three R,G,B dimensions are different among different color blocks. It worths noting that these changes are not made manually, they are made randomly by the system.
